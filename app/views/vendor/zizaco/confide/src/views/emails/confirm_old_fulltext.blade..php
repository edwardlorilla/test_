In a moment, I'll ask you to confirm your email address so you can begin enjoying ilys.  But first, please have a look at the following instructions.  They'll help make your writing sessions great!<br/>
<br/>
Here's how you will write with ilys:<br/>
<br/>
- Confirm your email address.<br/>
- Visit ilys.com and sign into your account.<br/>
- You will arrive at the Dashboard.<br/>
- Click "Create new session" to begin a new session.<br/>
- At the next screen, tell ilys how many words you want to write before you can edit.<br/>
- Choose if you want Ninja Mode -- this will not show you any letters at all while you write.<br/>
- Click the "GO!" button to start your session.<br/>
- Start typing and keep typing until you've reached your word count goal, and beyond.<br/>
- When you've reached your word count goal, you will see an orange arrow on the right side of the screen.<br/>
- Clicking this arrow will bring you to the edit screen.<br/>
- Edit, if you wish, your work and click on the "Save" button on the upper right corner.<br/>
- If you want this session to be part of a new story, enter a new story name in the textbox.  If this is a continuation of a story, select the story you want in the drop-down list.<br/>
- Click the "Save your session" button and arrive again at the Dashboard screen.<br/>
<br/>
While writing, you will see 3 icons on the upper left side of the screen.  They are:<br/>
* "Home" -- return to the dashboard.<br/>
* "Settings" -- return to the session setup screen.<br/>
* "Peek" -- see what you're writing, but only if you must.<br/>
<br/>
On the lower right corner of the screen is the "Ninja Mode" switch.  You can turn Ninja Mode on and off by clicking on this switch.<br/>
<br/>
A quick word about browsers: The official recommended browser for ilys is Google Chrome, though most will work well.  Some users experience issues with Firefox because of a feature that pops up a search textbox when you type the apostrophe.  When this happens, people keep typing and not seeing that their text is going into the searchbox instead of into ilys.  Also, ilys does not yet support phones or tablets and needs an actual keyboard to enter your text.<br/>
<br/>
For your first session, please start easy with about 50 words or so to try it out.  Press the all buttons and see what they do.  Get really comfortable with everything and then start to go bigger and bigger with your goals.<br/>
<br/>
Try to notice your experience as your write.  You might find yourself letting go of the need to want to change anything and just keep writing, knowing that the editing phase will come later.  Many ilys users report feelings of exhilaration when this letting go feeling happens and the words just start to flow, sometimes faster than the thoughts come.  Just remember to breathe, relax and simply let this flow continue.  It's a wonderful state to be in and has the potential to create amazing works!<br/>
<br/>
Now, before you can start having fun with ilys, please confirm your email address by visiting this link:<br/>

    {{{ URL::to("users/confirm/{$user['confirmation_code']}") }}}
</a><br/>
<br/>
If I can ever assist you or answer any questions, you will see a messagebox at the bottom of your dashboard.  Say hi :-)<br/>
<br/>
Wishing you many wonderful experiences with ilys,<br/>
Mike<br/>
