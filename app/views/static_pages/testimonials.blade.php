                        This is the best program ever. I wrote 4000 words in one day when in the past I was lucky to get down 500 because of how much of a perfectionist I was being and constantly editing as I went. The 4000 words I threw down were certainly terribly written, but I really don't care because *the words are down and moving the story forward*! This is the best tool for compulsive editors during <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org" target="_new">NaNoWriMo</a>. I can make the writing good later, but for now, getting the words on the page using this program might actually make me successful this <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org" target="_new">NaNo</a>. Thank you thank you thank you.

                        ilys forces me to get something down. I have a tendency to try and edit as I write, which means it can take me hours to write something even fairly short, and in the end I am not happy with the result. With ilys I know that I can't change anything until I reach my word goal. Also, the simplicity of the site really helps to minimize distractions.

                        ilys helps with my writing when I'm having trouble focusing. It's great how it makes the whole screen dark and shows only one letter at a time so I can't go back and edit or get distracted by other tabs. I also like the word count feature. Knowing I have to write a certain number of words before I can edit them keeps me going until I reach the goal.

                        ilys helps me to concentrate on writing. I have problems with staying focused on writing and not going back and fixing mistakes and typos and reading what nonsense I am creating :) When I can't see what I write I can simply write further without caring too much. It turned out to be really useful during <a href="http://www.campnanowrimo.org" target="_new">NaNoCamp</a> :)

                        I heard of ilys through a writing website I found on Google when I was in a rather large slump. I didn't have any inspiration and no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't put words on the paper without going back and deleting them, or changing them.<br/><br/>
            Then I started using ilys. Suddenly the words flowed more easily, and I didn't think about what I had already written - only what was still to write. It took a while to get used to not seeing what I was typing, but once I got used to that I found it refreshing to type without seeing my words. I couldn't look back on what I had already written, only forward at what was still to be written. The words began to flow naturally.<br/><br/>
            Since I began using ilys my overall word counts have increased quickly. I have gotten more writing done than I had before I began using this tool, but I still never lost my place due to the view of the last letter I had written. ilys is a great tool for first drafts, especially when the writer is struggling not to edit what they've already written when they've still got more to write. I am extremely glad I began using this tool, and I hope more people are able to prosper in the same way I have with ilys.

                        I have difficulty with creative writing because I constantly need to be editing what I've already written and it prevents me from progressing very far with the rest of the story. With ilys, since I cannot nitpick at what I've already written I have to keep going with the story.

                        It helps me turn off my inner editor more effectively than anything else I've ever tried. I have the idea, I need to get it down on paper, I start to write... and then as soon as something doesn't phrase quite the way I like it, I stop and rethink and immediately bog down. With ilys, I might write something that doesn't sound right, but I can't see it so I can put it aside and keep writing. It's easy to go back and fix it later. And this way I keep writing.

It's helped me out so much with NaNoWriMo this year, as I'm terrible for reading and rereading everything I've written over and over, editing as I go along. ilys removes that option, which has really helped me bump up my word count and keep on top of everything. :)

                        Just write it out; don't worry about structure and appearance. Give yourself the right to express what's in you, express your knowledge, creativity, imagination.

                        I use and support ilys because it allows me to be creative, while freeing me from the daunting task of filling up a blank screen. Compulsive editing was also holding me back from my full creative potential. ilys forces me to think differently by turning off the editor so that my mind can create without distraction. ilys is also an excellent tool for those like myself whom prefer to write or take notes privately; your work isn't visible to anyone until you're ready to make it visible! An excellent tool for writers of all ages. A sincere thank you to my friend and ilys creator, Mike G.

A friend who is an established playwright once told me the importance of "don't get it right, get it written", and ilys is the perfect tool for priming the creative pump and getting the flow going.  I've only been on it for 10 minutes, and I am hooked!

                        Since you don't have to worry about editing, you can let your creativity flow. It can be frustrating, but it's also liberating because you have to let it go.

                        I was introduced to ilys today. I have not stopped using it! :) It works great. I love it. I'm writing my debut novel and managed to write 1500 words just today! I had been in a slump for the past 2 weeks, so this has helped me tremendously. Thanks for putting this together!

                        When I first heard about ilys, I thought to myself, "This can't be helpful for me. It sounds so frustrating!" However, I tried it, and I was astounded by how much I was able to get done. Now, I can write about a thousand words in half an hour, which is perfect for <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org" target="_new">NaNoWriMo</a> and <a href="http://www.campnanowrimo.org" target="_new">Camp NaNoWriMo</a>. I recommended it to my sister, and now we both use it daily. Good job, guys!

                        ilys is absolutely awesome. I am currently participating in the <a href="http://www.campnanowrimo.org" target="_new">Nanowrimo camp</a> month-long novel write and it is really helping me to achieve my word-count goals. Before I was trying to write in 300 word sessions multiple times throughout the day but was finding it very difficult to accomplish these quickly and effectively. When I started using ilys I have upped my word-count daily goal from 500 words per day to 1000. Having said this, thank you so much for this program.

                        ilys is perhaps the most annoying thing I have ever encountered on the internet. I love it! My biggest problem with writing is that I can't ever get my editor brain and my creative brain to stop mingling, and this program solves it wonderfully! I churned out 1,000 words for my novel-in-progress in no time at all, when it usually takes me more than an hour! In short, even though I despise every aspect of this program with every fiber of my being, it is brilliant in that it is teaching me how to become a better writer. Thanks!

                        I found this website today via <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org" target="_new">NaNoWriMo</a> and wow this is very, very useful. Not only is the "block your inner editor" very useful, but it's a great way of doing "I won't take a break until I've done 1000 words" kind of thing. It really does make things flow really well too, because I often go back and re-read sentences which can be a big distraction. I think the black background works really well to because it's minimally distracting. THANK YOU FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL GIFT OF A WEBSITE.
