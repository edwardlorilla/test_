This beautiful and delicious state of being is sometimes called a <strong>peak experience</strong> -- something rare and hard to find.  We've discovered that this state of flow can be had easily and effortlessly by training ourselves to let go of our inner-editor while our creative-genius is given the freedom to run wild with unbounded expression.  Cultivating this flow within you is why ilys exists.</p>

            <strong>Thomas Harper says:</strong> I had two four thousand words sessions today. Since I worked last night, today is my first day and that makes this my most successful start to nanowrimo in my eleven years taking part in the event.<br/><br/>
            <strong>Callie Sandberg says:</strong> Just want to say thank you to ilys for allowing me to start writing 5,000 words without looking back at my mistakes. This NaNo year will be the year that I win thanks to this website.<br/><br/>
            <strong>Arya Turner says:</strong> ilys helps me to concentrate on writing. I have problems with staying focused on writing and not going back and fixing mistakes and typos and reading what nonsense I am creating :) When I can't see what I write I can simply write further without caring too much. It turned out to be really useful during NaNoCamp :)<br/><br/>
            <strong>Ellie McRitchie says:</strong> ilys is fantastic! It's helped me out so much with NaNoWriMo this year, as I'm terrible for reading and rereading everything I've written over and over, editing as I go along. ilys removes that option, which has really helped me bump up my word count and keep on top of everything. :)<br/><br/>
            <strong>Ella says:</strong> When I first heard about ilys, I thought to myself, "This can't be helpful for me. It sounds so frustrating!" However, I tried it, and I was astounded by how much I was able to get done. Now, I can write about a thousand words in half an hour, which is perfect for NaNoWriMo and Camp NaNoWriMo. I recommended it to my sister, and now we both use it daily. Good job, guys!<br/><br/>
            <strong>Solomon says:</strong> ilys is absolutely awesome. I am currently participating in the Nanowrimo camp month-long novel write and it is really helping me to achieve my word-count goals. Before I was trying to write in 300 word sessions multiple times throughout the day but was finding it very difficult to accomplish these quickly and effectively. When I started using ilys I have upped my word-count daily goal from 500 words per day to 1000. Having said this, thank you so much for this program.<br/><br/>
            <strong>Charlie says:</strong> I found this website today via NaNoWriMo and wow this is very, very useful. Not only is the "block your inner editor" very useful, but it's a great way of doing "I won't take a break until I've done 1000 words" kind of thing. It really does make things flow really well too, because I often go back and re-read sentences which can be a big distraction. I think the black background works really well to because it's minimally distracting. THANK YOU FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL GIFT OF A WEBSITE.<br/><br/>
            <strong>Babette says:</strong> I LOVE ilys it helped me SO much for NaNoWriMo last November and it's helping again this year! Thank you so much for this awesome website!

We want that freedom of expression to ripple through your writing into a fuller flow in every area of your life.  We want you to thrive in every way and to be joyous in the ecstasy of your creation!  You have access to this exclusive offer because we know you're awesome and we think we'll like you... a lot!<br/><br/>

            Because ilys isn't for everybody, you'll want to <a href="/users/create" role="button">try ilys</a> before you buy and make sure it's really for you. It takes a certain kind of person to allow themselves to experience the letting go that ilys facilitates so beautifully.  It's in that letting go that vast torrents of creativity can flow.  While ilys isn't for everybody, for those of us who get it, we LOVE it!  We know that to truly understand what this is all about, you need to actually use it and have the experience.  So go ahead, <a href="/users/create" role="button">create an account</a> and take ilys for a very long test-drive.</p>
            <br/>
            <p class="lead text-justify">Because ilys is unique, it might seem very weird at first.  This weirdness is your first opportunity to practice letting-go with ilys.  Get past any thoughts you have about it and just start typing, and just keep typing.  Any thoughts you have that cause you to slow down, pause or stop, let them go and continue typing.  Just keep going and see what happens.  Try to get your fingers moving faster than your thoughts and see what happens.  Notice yourself creating as you practice letting go.  You might just enter the magic space and completely surprise yourself with the genius you unleash when your inner-editor takes a nap while you write.
